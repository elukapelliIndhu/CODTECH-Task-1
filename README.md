## Overview of the Project

### Project: TO -DO LIST WEB APPLICATION

### Objective: 
The objective of this task is to craft a user-friendly to-do list web app with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript! The To-Do List web application helps users keep track of tasks, set priorities, and mark them as completed.

### Key Activities:

**Add a Task:** Users can add tasks by typing in the input field and clicking an "Add" button.

**Mark as Complete:** Users can click a checkbox or a button to mark tasks as complete, which updates the task visually (e.g., strikethrough effect).

**Delete a Task:** A "Delete" button allows users to remove tasks from the list.

**Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, making it accessible on different screen sizes.

**Task Persistence (Optional):** Tasks can be stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

**Interactive UI:** The app provides visual feedback (hover effects, animations) to enhance user interaction.

### Tecnologies Used:

**HTML:** To structure the web page, define sections like task input, task list, buttons, etc.

**CSS:** For styling the app, making it visually appealing with animations, layout responsiveness, and transitions.

**Key CSS concepts:** Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries

**JavaScript:** To add interactivity, manage task operations (adding, deleting, marking complete), and optionally use local storage to persist data.

**Key JavaScript concepts:** Event Listeners, DOM Manipulation, Arrays, Local Storage API (optional).
